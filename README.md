Reasons for the desing

This architecture has been decided and not the lambda options of AWS, 
thinking of making the code of the cloud provider independent.
This code is part of a platform for mobile devices (second screen) and it has been 
decided to eliminate proprietary technologies. 
The lambda functions of AWS are slow to wake up around 200-900 ms, 
during which time on the second screen platforms, a large number of devices are lost 
on the stage of the beginning of a television program, where the first minutes of the 
same is where the highest number of users of users is reached.
For the same reason the AWS balancers need a preheating, and because of this, 
it is proposed in case of balancing the rest service the use of a haproxy configured 
in failover. 
This architecture has been successfully tested in second screen events such as Masterchef
Spain (2014-2017 editions) as well as Televisa Networks Mexico (login & logout editions) 
as well as in different TV series on NBC Telemundo (señor de los cielos & señora acero ...)
As part of the design of the second screen platform, you can consult the e2e user layer 
based on sockets in my git. This type of e2e architectures allow asynchronous bidirectional 
communication between users, also allowing the sending of events with the rabbitmq pattern.


Architecture

api server -> rabbitmqn-> [subscribers	1..n] -> mongodb + nodemailer					
 
this architecture has been chosen based on queues, 
since it allows horizontal growth and scaling by increasing the number of subscribers

Requirements

• Create an API to post a message which can be delivered to a recipient via
email and keep a record of it

• Create an API to retrieve the messages sent to a particular recipient

• Think about how you can secure the above feature

Software needed

• You need a rabbitmq queue installed.

• You need a mongodb v.3.5 database in replicaset mode (see url string connection) no user and pass needed

• You need an account to nodemailer to send emails.

[server.js]

This server is create at nodejs cluster mode, and enable send and reveive using "post" method 
email field and msg field (x-www-form-urlencoded) are mandatory fields.
The send method are named "send", and you can access them using http or https protocol.

command line cluster server.

example: node server.js --ip 0.0.0.0 --http 3000 --https 3443

default values: 0.0.0.0 for ip, 3000 (http) 3443 (https)

listen all network interfaces:0.0.0.0 and publish (https) with autogenerated certificates.

Server can handle 5000 to 25000 request/second depending your processor (i5 i7) and memory (8GB or 16GB)


[send]

• read data from user & encrypt data object

• put a user email & msg into a rabbitmq queue

• response with 200 or 500 http code

[recover]

• recover data for email(s) user(s) email & msg in array object

• decrypt the mongodb data

• response with 200 or 500 http code

[subscriber.js]

it is a rabbitmq consumer that receive a message from server queue and store it at mongodb
and performs a email to user, using nodemailer.
you can launch to many consumers if you need best perfomance.
Rabbitmq workers using a round robin pattern to distribute tasks

This workers notify to server process ones operating has been done (ack).

Nodemailer

you must put your node mailer account:
configuration example:
var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
		host: 'mail.xxx.com',
		port: 465,
		secure: true, // true for 465, false for other ports
		auth: {
			user: 'no-reply@xxx.com', // replace by your email to practice
			pass: 'xxx' // replace by your-password
		}
	});

Scale up:
You can scale up server, using:
load balancer element -> point to a different server(s)
then https certificate will be installed on lbe redirecting to http server port.
You can scale up server using kubernetes or aks8 (microsoft) with image docker.
Dockerfile is not present in this code review.

Security:

• all api works in https mode and send data with post.

• It was relatively easy to add a temporary token in the request that would allow the operation
to be performed in a user-defined time.

• server & subscriber & rabbitmq work with message with encrypt objects.

• mongodb email collection saved encrypt document:

It looks like this:

{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5bc0c95c79f9679c13a69779"),
    "email" : "ྐྞྗ྘ྚྐྖ࿗྘ྋྐྃ྘ྐྵྞྔ྘ྐྕ࿗ྚྖྔ",
    "msg" : "ྑྜྕྕྖ࿙ྎྖྋྕྜྷ"
}

original object:

{
        "_id": "5bc0c95c79f9679c13a69779",
        "email": "ignacio.ariza@gmail.com",
        "msg": "hello world"
}
